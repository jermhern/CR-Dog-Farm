		<p>The Ovesen Family welcomes you to Cedar River Dog Farm!</p>
		<p>The whole Ovesen family loves to help out around the farm, and also play with the dogs! Your dog will come to know and love all of the members of Cedar River Dog Farm! We can't wait to meet your dog!</p>

		<p><strong>From Farm to Dog Hotel</strong><br>The Ovesen's originally bought the Farm in Maple Valley when it was a quaint 106 year old farm. With a little elbow grease, and a lot of imagination we turned an old-fashioned horse stable into cozy bedrooms for man's best friend!</p>

		<p><strong><i>Why We Went to the Dogs</i></strong><br><br>"We were trying to take a family vacation but just couldn't find a place where we felt comfortable leaving our pets! When your pets are your family too, you want to be sure they'll be taken care of. After searching and searching for a place for our three dogs, with no luck, Cedar River Dog Farm became a dream and then a reality. It's one of the best jobs, in our opinion. Who wouldn't want to play with dogs all day? When dogs come to stay and play at Cedar River Dog Farm, they become family. Come for a tour and see whyhundreds of dogs are now Cedar River Dogs!" <br><br>- The Ovesen Family</p>
